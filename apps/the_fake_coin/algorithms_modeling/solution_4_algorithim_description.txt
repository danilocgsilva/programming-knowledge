1. Separate all coins in two groups, trying match in the middle. If the whole group has a even number of coins, separates exact on the middle. If in odd number, set any of the group having just one coin more than another group.
2. Weigh the group one
3. Weigh the group two
4. Discover in which group the lightest coin is using proportionality
If one of the group has only one coin and another group has two coins
  If the fake coin is in the group of two coins, GO BACK TO STEP 1 WITH THIS GROUP
  Else if the fake coin is in the group of one coin
    5. The fake coin is in the lightest group
    End
Else if both group has one coin
  5. The fake group is in the lightest group
  End

Note: this is the solution more closely related to the answer that the Chatgpt gave. Just for know, here is what Chatgpt gave:

Now, regarding the algorithm to identify the fake coin with the minimum possible measurements, you can use a process of elimination. Here's an algorithmic approach:

1. Label the coins as A, B, C, D, and E for simplicity.
2. Weigh coins A, B, and C against coins D and E. There are three possible outcomes:
   a. If the scale is balanced, the fake coin is among D or E. Move to step 3.
   b. If the scale tilts, you know either A, B, or C is fake. Move to step 4.
3. Weigh coins D and E against each other. The lighter one is the fake coin.
4. If the scale tilts in step 2, weigh coins A and B against each other. If they balance, then coin C is fake. If they don't balance, the lighter coin among A and B is fake.

This algorithm ensures that you can determine the fake coin with just two uses of the scale in the worst case scenario.
