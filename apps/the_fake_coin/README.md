# The fake coin

There are several coins out there. Let's start with 5 coins, but one is always a fake coin. Let's assume as well that the fake coin has less weight tham the true one.

* `Coin`: The coin. Its unique property is its weight.
* `Scale`: A scale to tell how much weight something have, in the case, the coins. You can scale several coins on the scale at once.
* `CoinsDealer`: Its unique responsability is to provide an array of 5 coins, when one is the fake one.

Creates an algorithim that makes you discover which one of the 5 coins is the fake one with minimum possible measurements using the scale.
