# Tower of Hanoi

Imagine that you have three sticks. Also, imagine that you have three cylinders with a hole in the middle, so they can placed on the sticks. Further, imagine that all of those cylinders have different sizes, and they are all on the first stick. There  is a rule for filling the sticks: only a smaller cylinder can be positioned over a larger one. Thus, in the first stick where all cylinders are placed, the largest cylinder is at the bottom, the medium-sized cylinder is above the larger one, and the smallest cylinder is at the top.

The objective here is to transfer all cylinders from the first stick to the second one, allowing to use of the third. However, always follow this rule this rule while moving the cylinders: if you need place one cylinder on top of another, the cylinder above must never be larger than the one bellow.
