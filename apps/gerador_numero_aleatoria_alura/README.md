# Random number generator (from Alura)

## This is a bug hunter exercise

The objective of this simple frontend app is to allow user get some random numbers.

Users choose the amount of numbers to be created, the minimum value and the maximum value. The random numbers shall not repeat.

There's a situation where, depending on the value that the users gives, the application falls in an infinite loop, which obviously halts the browser. Find where it happens and also fix it to avoide such situation.
