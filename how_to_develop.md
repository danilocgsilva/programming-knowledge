# How to develop

## A roadmap to learn to develop from scratch

1. Basics
   1. Hello world in browser console
   1. My first code file: writting code in Notepad
   1. Executing your first *html*: Hello world in browser (still without html)
   1. Print anything you desire using Javascript: the console and the browser white screen
   1. Your first variable
2. Good to know an ide
   1. Your first operator: the plus (operating in your mother and faher's name)
   1. Step back to look into the computer environment: installing the Visual Studio Code
   1. Hello Visual Studio Code, understanding what is an text editor for development
   1. Some more coding in Visual Studio Code
3. From bare texts to first maths
   1. Plus operator in sum.
   1. Types: presening strings and integer and how it drives the plus operator
   1. Beyound the plus: minus, multiplication and division.
   1. Some another number operations
4. The dice path part 1: the first built-in (cool aids) functions
   1. Some maths built-in: random, round, floor, ceil and beyound
   1. Some anther exercises: operations with money!
   1. 0.0 up to 1 is not enough! The dice problem.
5. The dice path 2: your first custom function
   1. RPG dices: 4, 6, 8 10, 12 and 20 sides.
   2. Functions comes to rescue you!
   3. Working hard: a function for each dice.
   4. Using parameters: a smarter way to throw digital dices.
6. The browser path
   1. Html in everywhere! Source code in web browsers.
   1. The hello world alert in a random page!
   1. Your first html: Visual Studio Code comes into rescue!
   1. A little of css and style tag
   1. img tag
7. External script loading
   1. Loading external javascript
   1. Loading external css with link
   1. Paragraph and header
   1. class and id in css
8. Javascript interacting to html
    1. document.getElementById
    1. innerHTML
    1. Input button: your first user interaction
    1. Browser says: hello world!!!
9. More on user inputing and interaction
    1. input tag
    1. More user interactions with buttons, inputs and general DOM (this will take a little longer...)
10. The black window command prompt
    1. Step back againt to your environment: installing Node.js
    1. Redoing some exercises without browser
    1. Input from command line
    1. More exercises, but now accepting input from command line
11. Loop, if, comparision and array
    1. A whole class will be required...
12. Don't get stucked in just one language
    1. Python
    1. Python variables, functions, command line inputs, loop, ifs and array
13. Opening more the mind with PHP
    1. PHP
    1. PHP variables, functions, command line inputs, loop, ifs and array
14. Strong typing
    1. PHP: a simple door to type strength
15. Compiled language: Java
    1. More environment step back: installing JRE
    1. What is compilation
    1. Public static void main hello world
    1. I've writted a class! What is it?
16. C#
    1. Installing DOT NET CORE
    1. Just like Java
    1. Public static void main hello world again
17. The mother of languages: C
    1. Installing the clang
    1. How things differs in C?
    1. Variables, variables assigment, loops, command line input and functions.
