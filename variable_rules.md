# Variable rules

Variables is a way that all programing languages allow to store values, or can be understood also as a simple data that may be recovered in another part of program are returned to some *final usage*.

Usually, you may obey the following rules to write the variable name:
* Any alphanumeric character is allowed (uppercased and lowercased), plus the ubserscores character (`"_"`)
* *Special characters* are not allowed, for example, @, %, ^ and so on.

Worth to mention that programmers have setted conventions to *style* variables names. Read for example this reference: https://winnercrespo.com/naming-conventions/. You are not required to follow any of those conventions, but it is good to follow one to adds consistency to your code and let it more easy and fast to be read. Moreover, depending the language, you may look to the *language community*, which can prefer a style rather than another.

Nevertheless, different programming langues may varies a little in what is allowed to put as variables. Examples:

* in **PHP**, *all* varibles of all kinds must be written preceded by "`$`" sign.

* in **Perl**, just the *scalar* variables needs the "`$`" sign.

* in **Erlang**, variables *must* start with a uppercased character.

* in **javascript**, **C#**, **Java**, **Python**, **Shell** and others have no special rules beyond the *general rules* as chossing a variable name.
