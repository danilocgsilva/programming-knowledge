# Types

## PHP

**Integers**

Ex:

* 643
* -149
* 0x1A
* 0123

---

**Float or integers**

Ex:

* 2.21334234125E+23
* 5.54
* 4.E-10

**Notice**: the example 2.21334234125E+23 could be an integer. But the php interpreter set it to a double.

---

**Boolean**

Ex:

* true
* false

Only those two are possible as boolean.

---

**Array**

Ex:

* [ 2, 4, 7, 8, 11.6 ]
* [ 223.1, 0.3, "Doug", "Funny" ]
* [ "alfa", "beta", "gamma" ]

---

**Object**

* (new SomeObject())

---

**Null**

Only one, the `null` itself.

---

**Resource**

An special object's type, which holds references to some external resource, as database connection or a file system file.
