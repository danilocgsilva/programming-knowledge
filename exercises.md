# Exercises

## Very basic

1. Write a loop that prints `hello` ten times.

## Problems solved by the basics

1. Write a program that prints every number from 0 to 1 that has a single digit after the decimal place (that is, 0.1, 0.2 and so on).

2. Writes a program that receives a numeric argument and checks its value. If the value is greater than the 17, them prints "`Currently, is in adulthood and can take on responsabilities`". Otherwise, prints "`Depends upon adult, not allowed to take serious chooses`". Or something like that.

3. Creates a *virtual dice*. Each time you use it, a random number between 1 and 6 are given.

4. Create *virtual dices* for D&D. This game also needs dices with different amount of sides, which are 4, 8, 10, 12 and 20 sides. Create a function for each case.

5. Create a *variable dice*. Suppose that you will always requires throw dices with diffenrent sides. Create a single function that allows you to have random numbers from 1 until 6, 4, 8, 10, 12, 20, 7, 66, 102, 1005, or whichever the user wants.

6. Creates a function that tells an *amount of oranges that you have*. For example: if a have no oranges, then prints "I have no organges.". If I have one orange, them prints "I have one orange". If have 2 or more oranges, them prints "I have several oranges".

## Basic of classes

1. Write a class called `Person`. The class must have it's height and weight as a property. Also, a property called name (helding the person name) to facilitates the person identification. Then, in the class itself also must have a method that calculates the BMI, call this method as `getMbi`. And finally, write another method called `condition`, that just prints a *person condition*, stating that the person is *thin*, *normal* or *overweight*, based on the data in https://www.diabetes.ca/managing-my-diabetes/tools---resources/body-mass-index-(bmi)-calculator.
